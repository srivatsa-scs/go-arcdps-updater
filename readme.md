# A simple go program to update your Guild Wars 2 Arc dps

1. Read through this code and check to see if it's doing something stupid.
2. If you're happy with step 1, then clone the repository.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/srivatsa-scs/go-arcdps-updater
```
3. Make sure you have the necessary requirements such as go 1.16.3
4. Set up your configuration file. If you're using defaults, then rename the config.sample.json -> config.json
5. You can either run or build an exe using
```
$ go run .
or
$ go build .
```
6. Build option will give you an exe file (in windows) that you can use to run it.
